	<p><em>Hi!</em> My name is Anaya Iyer. <br><br>
	Creating content has always been my passion. Telling a story through any kind of medium is so interesting to me, which is why I enjoy animating, drawing and editing so much! 
	<br><br>
	I've grown my social media pages from the ground up and have high hopes that I can grow my audience. Through my job as a freelance editor and artist, I've learned how to interact with clients, meet deadlines, and create something people will genuinely love.

<!--I've been drawing for as long as I can remember. To this day, I hear stories of me waking up at 6 am as a child to draw (however horribly) my favorite characters. Later, I discovered that I could make my drawings move and decided right then and there that I would become an artist when I grew up.
I've been working nonstop since then to improve my art and design skills. Over this time period, my animation placed top 6 in a challenge, I've built my Instagram page from the ground up, and have had my art displayed in the school lobby.-->
